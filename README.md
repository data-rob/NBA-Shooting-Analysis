# NBA-Shooting-Analysis
Career Foundry Final Project on Tableau

This statistical analysis sourced data from the NBA provided by the website Sports Reference. 

The analysis covers a variety of variables that both measure and impact a player's shooting ability. The goal of the analysis is to identify factors that have significant effects on shooting ability and determine if those factors could be used to predict future players' abilities.

Why I chose this dataset: Basketball is something that I am very passionate
about and using Sports Reference to look up statistics about different players
and games is something that I am not a stranger to. Sports Reference is a
trusted data source among many basketball fans and analysts. There are
other databases too with good reputations like StatMuse but for the purpose
of familiarity I chose Sports Reference.

Data Source - All basketball statistics and data were collected from the Sports
Reference website. Sports Reference is a public domain that provides data
about the Nation Basketball Association as well as other professional leagues.
The data it provides is all public knowledge.

Data Collection - The data is collected by sourcing it from "sportradar"-the
offficial stats partner of the NBA, NHL and MLB

Data Limitations - This data is limited because it does not contain all of the
variables for the planned analysis.

Data Relevance - This dataset is crucial to the project because it provides
descriptive statistics of the impact that players make on the basketball game.
These different statistics can be used to determine the skill level of a
particular player and compare them to other players around the league.

Data Contents - The dataset contains data from 2019 until 2023. The variables
of the dataset are recorded statistics from all NBA regular season games from
the 2019-2020 season until the 2022-2023 season. These variables include
points scored, steals, blocks, free throw percentage and several others. The full
list and abbreviations can be seen below.

attempts blocked by the player while he was on the floor.

eFG% - Effective Field Goal Percentage; the formula is (FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA.

point than a 2-point field goal. For example, suppose Player A goes 4 for 10
with 2 threes, while Player B goes 5 for 10 with 0 threes. Each player would
have 10 points from field goals, and thus would have the same effective field
goal percentage (50%).

performance." Please see the article Calculating PER for more information.
Per 36 Minutes - A statistic (e.g., assists) divided by minutes played, multiplied
by 36.
